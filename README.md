### What's Support Vector Machine (SVM)?
A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, theyâ€™re able to categorize new text.

So youâ€™re working on a text classification problem. Youâ€™re refining your training data, and maybe youâ€™ve even tried stuff out using [Naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier "Wiki on Topic"). But now youâ€™re feeling confident in your dataset, and want to take it one step further. 
Enter [Support Vector Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine "Wiki page on the topic"). (SVM): a fast and dependable classification algorithm that performs very well with a **limited amount of data** to analyze.

### Words of advice. (Procedure? maybe? ðŸ¤”)
1. The original pictures are in img_data, run python main.py in terminal to recognise them, 
2. Add your own examples in img_data if you'd like to...
3. To generate Training images you can also use main.py for segmentation procession, etc.
4. Read the comments in main.py for a better understanding.

Please ðŸŒŸ This repo if you learn something from this, It helps the algorithm to learn.

I wish to use this in another bigger project. Please hit me up with a DM you'd like to collab.
